            Let’s keep it real - $UPTOBER is not a security, investment, or
            financial advice. It’s a meme token, born to make Radix a little
            wilder and a lot more fun.

            There’s no roadmap to riches, only community vibes, and a mission to
            Moowwwn together. If you buy, do it because you believe in the
            energy - not because your cousin said it’ll 100x.
          </p>
          <p>Stay bullish, stay responsible, and keep it UP. Always.</p>
